ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that Y could have borrowed the name not directly from Polish, but from a local German dialect spoken in Poland. This would explain the reflexes of protovowel E₃ (Proto-EY *tandeyt; CY tandayt), from a lengthened /e/ in an open syllable. Beider suggests that the short form טאַנדעט may be influenced by Belarusian тандэт.  
Polish tandeta.
