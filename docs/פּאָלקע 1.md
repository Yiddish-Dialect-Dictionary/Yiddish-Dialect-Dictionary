ETYMOLOGY
===========
Polish pałka.
Beider suggests that the word was borrowed from Old Polish *pa:lka, before the 16th c., when the first vowel was long /aː/ (perhaps the vowel was lengthened in a stressed syllable before /l/ and a second consonant). The vowel merged with A₂ and had the corresponding different realizations in Yiddish dialects (NEY polke / SEY pulke). 
{Beider 2015: 448, 455}
