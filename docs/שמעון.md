שמעון
'Simon (man's name)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Max Weinreich posits that the initial ש was pronounced with an apical /s̺/ in early Old Yiddish which subsequently became /z/, as in the diminutive form זימל. However, forms like זימל likely came directly from MHG Simon, which, in any case, also had an apical /s̺/. 
{Beider 2001, 412, M. Weinreich, Geshikhte, 2: 37}
