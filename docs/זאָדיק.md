זאָדיק
'behind, backside'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Formally it could come either from Old Czech or Polish, but Beider thinks it belongs to a group of butcher's terms borrowed from Old Czech. He suggests that the root vowel (protovowel A₂, from a long /aː/) stems from Czech á {although the vowel in Czech zadek appears to be short}
Old Czech zadek; Polish zadek. 
[Beider 2015: 430, 455]
