קלויצען
קאַלויצען
'to stir vigorously'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider argues that the word must have been borrowed from Old Polish before the 16th c. while the vowel of kłócić was still long /oː/.
Polish kłócić 'to quarrel'. Also 'to churn (butter)' in Polish Silesian dialect. 
{Beider 2015: 446}
Perhaps also influence from Belarusian калаци́ць; Ukrainian: колоти́ти.
