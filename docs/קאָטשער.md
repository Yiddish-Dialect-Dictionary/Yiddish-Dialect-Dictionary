'drake, male duck'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that Y could have borrowed the word not directly from Polish, but from a local German dialect spoken in Poland. This would explain the reflexes of protovowel A₃, from a lengthened /a/ in an open syllable.
Polish kaczor (from the 15th c., based on kaczka; see קאַטשקע).
{Beider 2015: 454; Boryś 218}
