 טרייסלען
געטרייסלט
'to shake'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
{The ־לען suffix is typically used to form verbs out of noun roots.}
The vowel and the /r/ suggest East Slavic origin (rather than Polish trząść, trzęsi). The ־ל־ is also unusual, but the form's strangeness "suggests some antiquity."
{Herzog 1964: 83}
Beider suggests the word may be from the East Cnaanic substrate - from the Slavic language originally spoken by Jews in the Grand Dutch of Lithuania before they shifted to Yiddish (by the 17th c.). The /l/ was introduced due to consonant dissimilation.
{Beider 2015: 440-1}
Ukrainian трясти́; Belarusian трэ́сці; Russian трясти́; Polish trząść
