קראָשניק
קרושניק
'Kraśnik (town in southeastern Poland)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that the name was borrowed from Old Polish, before the 16th c., when the vowel of Kraśnik was long /aː/ (perhaps the vowel was lengthened in a stressed syllable before two consonants of which the first is a sibilant). The vowel merged with A₂ and had the corresponding different realizations in Yiddish dialects (e.g., "Krūshnik" in CY).
