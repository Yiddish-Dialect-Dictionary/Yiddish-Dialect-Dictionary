סקאָל
'Sokal (town in westernUkraine)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that the name was borrowed from Old Polish, before the 16th c., when the second vowel of Sokal was still long /aː/. The vowel merged with A₂ and had the corresponding different realizations in Yiddish dialects (e.g., "Skūl" in CY). 
{Beider 2015: 448}

/SKU:L/ {Yiddishland, Paul Glasser}
