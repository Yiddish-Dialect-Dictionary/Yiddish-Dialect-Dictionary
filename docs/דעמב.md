דעמב
דוב
'oak tree; oak wood'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
{Perhaps דעמב/דאָמב are the older forms, from Polish, competing with a newer East Slavic form דוב.}
{Geller and Gajek, 2023: 55}
Polish dąb; cf, Belarusian дуб, Ukrainian дуб; Russian дуб; from Proto-Slavic *dǫbъ; from PIE *dʰónu, perhaps from the root *dem- 'to build', which also lies at the root of צימער, English timber.
