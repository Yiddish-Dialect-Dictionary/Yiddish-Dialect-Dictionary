ETYMOLOGY
===========
OHG ginamno, MHG g(e)nanne < ge-namne 'person with the same name; friend', ENHG genanne 'Namensbruder'
{Beider (2001) 508, BMZ 2, 313, DWB 5, 3345, FNHDW, Lexer 1, 853, 855, M. Weinreich, Geshikhte, 4: 122}

{WESTERN}
 גננא 
Approximate pronunciation /gəˈnanə/ in the earliest Hebrew sources (11th-15th c.), in Latin sources <Gnanna> or <Genanna>.
The diminutive of the name (with umlaut of /a/ to /e/), which became the predominant form, was first recorded in 1298 in a South German Hebrew source as גנענלין.
The /d/ in the Eastern from גנענדל appears like the epenthetic /d/ characteristic for diminutives of words ending in /n/, but in fact it arose early, probably through a confusion with MHG genende 'word; person', as in Bavarian genannter. The name is first recorded with /d/ in a Hebrew source from Frankfurt am Main from 1622: גנענדל.
