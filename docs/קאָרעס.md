ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider notes that Y could have borrowed the word either from German (which would explain protovowel A₃ from a lengthened /a/ in an open syllable) or from Polish. {Probably Y borrowed from both, which explains why the vowel varies.}
MHG karaʒ, karas; probably borrowed from Polish karaś or another Slavic language; from Proto-Slavic *karasь.
Related to NHG Karausche.
{Beider 2015: 454; DW¹ 11: 205}
