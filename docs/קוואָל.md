קוואָל
'Kowal (town in central Poland)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that the name was borrowed from Old Polish, before the 16th c., when the second vowel of Kowal was still long /aː/. The vowel merged with A₂ and had the corresponding different realizations in Yiddish dialects (e.g., "Kvūl" in CY). 
{Beider 2015: 448}

/K(E)VU:(E)L/ {Yiddishland, Paul Glasser}
