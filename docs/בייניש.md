בייניש
'Beinish (name)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that Y could have borrowed the name not directly from Czech Beneš/Beniš (short for Benedikt), but from a local German dialect spoken in Czech lands. This would explain the reflexes of protovowel E₃ (NEY Beynesh / CY Baynesh), from a lengthened /e/ in an open syllable. The name Benusch was also used by Germans in medieval Silesia. 
{Beider 2015: 454}
