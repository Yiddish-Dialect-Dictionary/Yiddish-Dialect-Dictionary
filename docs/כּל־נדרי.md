Kol Nidre {HOLLAND, Beem, Jerosche}
	•	Die halt schount an ir zwaate kol nidre. 'When a maid started talking, one said: she already has her second Kol Nidre. It was said the second time that the reader reads this form on Kol Nidre evening. On the night before the Day of Atonement, this happens three times and ever louder. So she spoke louder, bolder.' {Jerosche №495}
