ריישע
'Rzeszów  (city in southeastern Poland)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider argues that Yiddish borrowed the name not from Polish Rzeszów, but from German Resche, in which the vowel had already been lengthened in an open syllable (so properly protovowel E₂ in Y). 
ENHG Resche; from Polish Rzeszów.
{Beider 2015: 454}
