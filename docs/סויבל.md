סויבל

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that סויבל is of "blended Slavic-German origin." The diphthong stems from a long /oː/ present in the German cognate (NHG Zobel). 
{It looks as though the initial affricate of MHG/ENHG zobel was simplified to /s/ due to the influence of the the Slavic cognates.}
MHG zobel; from OHG zobel; from East Slavic (Russian) со́боль. 
Cf. Polish soból; Ukrainian соболь.
