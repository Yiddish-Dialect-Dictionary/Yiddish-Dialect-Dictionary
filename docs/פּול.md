פּול

'dust (collective)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
{Why Yiddish /u/ instead of /i/? Perhaps a hypercorrection on the border area between CY and NEY and SEY? See Herzog's map below.}
Herzog suggests פּול is from Belarusian.
Polish pył; Belarusian пыл; Ukrainian пил; cf. Russian пыль; from Proto-Slavic *pylъ. 
{Herzog 1964: 124}
