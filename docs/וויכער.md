ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider regards the long /iː/ in CY vīkher as a case of secondary lengthening before /x/ or /r/. 
[However, the stressed /i/ in Polish wicher sounds long to speakers of languages with distinctive vowel length (like CY or English) - so it is natural that CY borrowed the vowel as long /iː/ and not as short /ɩ/.
Polish wicher; Ukrainian вихор. 
[Beider 2015: 454]
