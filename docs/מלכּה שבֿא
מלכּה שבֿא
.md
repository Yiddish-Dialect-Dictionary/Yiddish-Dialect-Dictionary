מלכּה שבֿא
'The Queen of Sheba'

WESTERN
========

Male Schewo {HOLLAND, Beem, Jerosche}
	•	Die malke schewo ken man nit pattern. 'One cannot get rid of the queen of Sheba. Said of somebody who comes to visit and won't go away. Originally, however, probably in the sense of Goethe's Zauberling: "Die ich rief, die Geister, Werde nun nicht los." Based on a legend which tells how a scholar with the aid of the tetragram summoned the queen of Sheba, but was unable to make her disappear again. Hence the way of saying in Tendlau: "Steht wie die Malke-Schewo." (As far as the writer could verify, this last expression is not known in the Netherlands, or is no longer known).' {Jerosche №590}
Tendlau 1026, 1025, 555.
