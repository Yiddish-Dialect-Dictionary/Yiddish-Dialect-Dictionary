פֿאַרקאָכן
פֿאַרקאָכט

ETYMOLOGY
===========
One meaning of פֿאַרקאָכט 'enamored, in love with' appears to be borrowed from Polish kochać 'to love', zakochany w 'in love with'. Probably it began as play on words, since פֿאַרקאָכן meaning 'to cook up' is from MHG kochen, with the perfective prefix פֿאַר־ a calque for Polish za-. 

{WESTERN}
fərkɔxt פֿאַרקאָכט 'overcooked' {WTCP, Berettyó-Újfalu, 47212}
