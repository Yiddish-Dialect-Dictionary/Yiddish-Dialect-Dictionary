ביילעוו
'Bielawa (village south of Warsaw, Poland)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider notes that there is no indication that the name came through German. The vowel change {ie} > {ej} is also present in קווייט and קלייט. He suggests that the Yiddish diphthong arose due to "anticipatory softening" before a palatalized consonant.
Polish Bielawa.
