בידעווען
'to be miserable'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
{It seems likely that the word is from Ukrainian бiдувати, which has a similar vowel quality /i/ as in Y. CY-speakers could interpret that /i/ as long /iː/, as opposed to their short /ɩ/.}
Beider suggests that the long root vowel (cf. CY bīdivin) could be either I₂ (a long /iː/ from monophthongization of the diphthong in Polish biedować {Why would this give I₂? Beider suggests that the palatalization of the previous consonant could be the cause}) or I₃ (a lengthening of a short /i/ in an open syllable, from Ukrainian бiдувати).
