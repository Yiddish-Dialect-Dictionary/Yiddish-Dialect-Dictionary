ריקע

ETYMOLOGY
===========
{It seems very likely that the word is from Ukrainian рiка.}
Beider suggests that the long root vowel (cf. CY rīki) could be either I₂ (a long /iː/ from Polish rzeka {Why would this give I₂? Beider writes that the palatalization of the previous consonant could be the cause.}) or I₃ (a lengthening of a short /i/ in an open syllable, from Ukrainian рiка).
[Beider 2015: 454]
