'wheelbarrow'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Polish taczka, (dialectal) {tåčka/točka}); Ukrainian тачка; Belarusian тачка.
{Herzog 1964: 117}
Beider suggests that the word was borrowed from Old Polish, before the 16th c., when the vowel of Kraśnik was long /aː/ (perhaps the vowel was lengthened in a stressed syllable before two consonants of which the first is a sibilant). The vowel merged with A₂ and had the corresponding different realizations in Yiddish dialects (e.g., "tūtshke" in CY). 
{Beider 2015: 448}
