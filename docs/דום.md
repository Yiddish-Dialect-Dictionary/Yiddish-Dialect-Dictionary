ETYMOLOGY
===========
{Germanism borrowed from NHG in the 19th c.}
Got. dumbs 'dumb, mute', ON dumbr, OE dumb, English dumb, OS dumb, Dutch dom, OHG tumb, MHG tumb, tump, ENHG dumm, tumm, NHG dumm < PGmc. *dumba- 'dumb (original meaning: hazy)' (or 'mute') (DRV), derived from *dimban- ~ *dimpan- 'to fog' (MHG dimpfen 'to smoke, steam') < PIE *dʰémbʰ-e-; maybe related to *nebala (see נעפּל). 
Assimilation of -mb (MHG tumb) to -mm began in 13th c. Central German, spread though Upper German by the 15th c.
