זלמן
'Zalman (man's name)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Hebrew שלמה. Max Weinreich posits that the initial ש was pronounced with an apical /s̺/ in early Old Yiddish which subsequently became /z/, as in the זלמן. However, זלמן likely came directly from MHG Salman (?), which, in any case, also had an apical /s̺/.
[Beider 2001, 414, M. Weinreich, Geshikhte, 2: 37]
