ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that גדויל is probably a not a unique example of the diphthongization of protovowel U₄ in a Slavism borrowed from Polish. More likely it is from Old Czech kdoule or from an unattested form, already with a diphthong, used by German colonists in Poland or Czech lands.
Polish gdula.
{Perhaps the ready alternation in Y between גדול and גדולים and גדולה let to the form גדויל — to avoid the homonym גדולה.}
[Beider 2015: 455]
