'Wiślica (town in south-central Poland)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that Y borrowed the word not from Polish directly, but from the Silesian dialect of German colonists in Poland - in whose dialect the initial /i/, borrowed as MHG î, was diphthongized to NHG ei /aj/. This corresponds to protovowel I₄ in CY Vāslits.
Polish Wiślica.
[Beider 2015: 455]
