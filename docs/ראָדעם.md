'Radom (city in east-central Poland)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that Y could have borrowed the name not directly from Polish, but from a local German dialect spoken in Poland (perhaps from medieval Silesian German *Ra:dem). This would explain the reflexes of protovowel A₃ (CY Rūdem), from a lengthened /a/ in an open syllable.
Polish Radom.
{Beider 2015: 454}

/RU:DEM/ {Yiddishland, Paul Glasser}
