קאָליש
'Kalisz (Polish city west of Łódź)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Herzog writes that in CY קאָליזש was rendered Kuliš because the word entered Yiddish from a Polish dialect where the vowel was /o/, which was then subject to the regular shift o > u in SY. {However, קאָליש was possibly derived from the MHG or ENHG version of the city's name, Kalisch.}
{Herzog 1964: 117-119}
ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that Y could have borrowed the name not directly from Polish, but from a local German dialect spoken in Poland (perhaps from medieval Silesian German *Ka:lish). This would explain the reflexes of protovowel A₃ (CY Kūlish), from a lengthened /a/ in an open syllable.
Polish Kalisz.
