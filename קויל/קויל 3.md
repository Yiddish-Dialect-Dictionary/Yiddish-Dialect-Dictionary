'Koło (town in central Poland)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
The diphthong /oj/ must result from a long /oː/. The name Koło was borrowed very early so that the /o/ in an open syllable was lengthened — either within Old Yiddish itself or in the German from which Yiddish borrowed the name. (Beider denies the first possibility.)
