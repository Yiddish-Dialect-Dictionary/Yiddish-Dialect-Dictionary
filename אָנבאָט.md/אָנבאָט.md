ETYMOLOGY
===========
{Perhaps a Germanism borrowed from NHG? But NHG has mainly Angebot.}
{Interesting that NHG has a long /oː/, but East Yiddish dialects a short /o/ which never diphthongized.}
ON boð, OE bod 'command; message', Dutch bod 'bid', OHG bot 'authoritative pronouncement' < PGmc. -bud-a-ⁿ (or *buda-) 'offer' < *beud- < PIE *bhewdh-; derived from the strong verb *beudan-; 
NHG Anbot was largely displaced by Angebot in the 19th c.
