ETYMOLOGY
===========
{Although doll is ostensibly the Low German form, dol appears more often than tol in the MHG citations (of BMZ) and still quite often in the ENHG citations (of the FNHDW). On the other hand, the -u- vowel seems very rare.}
OE dol, OS dol, Dutch dull, OHG tol, MHG tol, dol 'foolish, nonsensical', ENHG toll, doll, NHG toll < PGmc. *dula- 'foolish, crazy' < *dʰul-o- (EUR), a zero-grade formation related to *dwelan- 'to err' (OE gedwolen 'wrong').
Full grade: Got. dwals 'foolish', Middle Dutch dwal.
Derivatives from PGmc. *dwela- 'to be confused': OE dwolian 'to err', Middle Dutch dwelen, OHG -twelan, MHG twel(e)n.
Related: Latvian duls 'furious', Welsh dall 'blind'.
