{CEYD}
sorrel, schav, sorrel soup

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that the word was borrowed from Old Polish, before the 16th c., when the vowel of szczaw was still long /aː/. The vowel merged with A₂ and had the corresponding different realizations in Yiddish dialects (e.g., "shchūv" in CY). 
{Beider 2015: 447}
Herzog writes that in CY שטשאַוו was rendered ščuf, probably because the word entered Yiddish from a Polish dialect where the vowel was /o/, which was then subject to the regular shift o > u in SY. {How widespread was this form?}
{Herzog 1964: 117-119}
