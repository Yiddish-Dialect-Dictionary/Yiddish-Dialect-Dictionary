ריבישויוו
'Hrubieszów (town in southeastern Poland)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider argues that the word must have been borrowed from Old Polish before the 16th c. while the final vowel of Hrubieszów was still long /oː/. Beider also conjectures that in Old Polish the name was stressed on the final syllable, as in Yiddish.
Polish Hrubieszów; cf. Ukrainian Грубешів.
