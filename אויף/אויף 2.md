אויף 2
'up (adverb)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
{Kroonen writes that the long vowel in OHG ūf (thus the diphthong in NHG auf and Yiddish אויף) arose from monosyllabic lengthening.
DW² notes that the vowel remained short in many dialects outside of Bavarian - perhaps that explains Northeastern Yiddish /uf/ (adv.). Also eastern Upper German and East Middle German af - perhaps that explains Northeastern Yiddish /af/ (prep.). Bavarian seems to have had a greater influence on Central Yiddish, which perhaps explains why the main form is /ɔuf/ (adv.)}
Got. iup, ON upp, OE up, English up, OS ū̆p, Dutch op (adv., prep.), OHG ūf, MHG ūf, ouf, uf, NHG auf (adv., prep.) < PGmc. *eup ~ *upp 'up, upwards (adv.) (or *up(a))' < *(h₁e)up-n- (DRV?) (or *upo).
Related: Sanskrit úpa, Hittite upzi '(the sun) rises', Greek ὑπό (prep.) 'below', ὕπο (adv.) 'below'
