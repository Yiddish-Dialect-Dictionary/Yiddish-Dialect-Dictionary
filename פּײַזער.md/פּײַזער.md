פּײַזער
'Pyzdry (town in central Poland)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that Y borrowed the word not from Polish directly, but from the Silesian dialect of German colonists in Poland - in whose dialect the initial vowel /ɨ/, borrowed as MHG î, was diphthongized to NHG ei /aj/. This corresponds to protovowel I₄ in CY Pāzer.
NHG Peisern; from Polish Pyzdry.
