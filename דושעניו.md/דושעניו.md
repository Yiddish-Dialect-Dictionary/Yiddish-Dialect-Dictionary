'my dear (endearment) (literally: my soul)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
{The initial stress in Yiddish is some indication that the word was borrowed from Polish. Interesting that the word is mainly used with the Slavic diminutive suffix -niu, although ליובע־דושע is also used.}
Polish dusza 'soul, spirit', Ukrainian душа́, Belarusian душа́; also Russian душа́, Old Church Slavonic duša < Proto-Slavic dušà 'soul' < Proto-Balto-Slavic *douṣjaʔ < PIE dʰous-i-eh₂; Lithuanian daũsios 'air'.
Related: Polish duch (see דוך), Ukrainian дух, Belarusian дух; also Russian дух, Old Church Slavonic duxŭ 'breath, spirit' < Proto-Slavic *dȗxъ 'breath, spirit' < Proto-Balto-Slavic *douṣos; cf. Lithuanian daũsos 'air, breath', dùsti 'to suffocate', dùsas 'asthma'.
English to doze, MHG dosen 'to keep oneself awake, slumber' < PGmc. *dusēn- 'to slumber (originally perhaps: to lose one's sense)'. "Apparently the Indo-Europeans assumed that the spirit (i.e. 'breath') left the body during sleep" (Kroonen). 
Latin furō 'to be mad, rave', OE dēor, English deer, OHG tior 'wild animal', NHG Tier (see 2 טיר) < PGmc. *deuza- '(wild) animal < *dʰeus-ó- (EUR),  from the root *dʰu̯es- 'to breathe'.
