דאַנקעווען
'to thank'
{Stutchkoff lists דאַנקעווען as a synonym of דאַנקען, but it appears to be used rarely and humorously.}

ETYMOLOGY
===========
A Germanic root (see דאַנקען) with the Slavic suffixe -eve-, perhaps influenced by Polish dziękować 'to thank'.The verbal suffix ־עווע־ is derived from the Polish suffixes -owa-, -ewa-, -ywa-, -iwa-.
