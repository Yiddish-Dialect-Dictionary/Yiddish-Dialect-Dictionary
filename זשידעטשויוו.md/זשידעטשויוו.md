ETYMOLOGY
===========
{Why does Yiddish stress the last syllable, unlike Polish and Ukrainian?}
Beider argues that the word must have been borrowed from Old Polish before the 16th c. while the vowel of Żydaczów was still long /oː/. Beider also conjectures that in Old Polish the name was stressed on the final syllable, as in Yiddish.
Polish Żydaczów; cf. Ukrainian Жида́чів.
