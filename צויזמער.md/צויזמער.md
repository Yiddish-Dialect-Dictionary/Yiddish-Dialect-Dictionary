ETYMOLOGY
===========
{What is the early German name that Y borrowed?}
Beider suggests that Y borrowed the name not from Polish directly, but from the Silesian dialect of German colonists in Poland - in whose dialect the vowel /ɔ/, borrowed as MHG û, was diphthongized to NHG au. This corresponds to protovowel U₄ in CY Tsouzmer.
Polish Sandomierz.
