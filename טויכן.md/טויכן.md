{GERMANISM}

ETYMOLOGY
===========
{Germanism borrowed from NHG in the 19th c. The word had died out in Upper German, but was reintroduced from medieval Central and Low German. Perhaps Yiddish never had it!}
English to duck, Dutch duiken 'to dive', OHG intūhhan 'to immerse', MHG tūchen, NHG tauchen < PGmc. *dūkan- 'to duck' (DRV), derived from the iterative *dukkōn-.
MHG tocken 'to immerse' < PGmc. *dukkōn- 'to duck' < *dʰugʰ-néh₂-, from the PIE root *dʰeugʰ- 'to be fit (perhaps earlier: to fall)' (see טויגן).
Related: MHG tucken, tücken, NHG ducken < *dukkjan- (see טוקן).
OE dūce, English duck.
