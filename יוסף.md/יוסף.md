יוסף
יוֹסֵף
'Joseph (man's name)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Although the holam is generally represented as usual in Northeastern as /ei/ and in Central as /oi/, Max Weinreich has no explanation for the /o/ in Southeastern /josəf/ (which American Hasidim, at least, maintain, for example, in יוסף־שפּיל 'traditional play about Joseph').
{M. Weinreich, Geshikhte, 4: 63}
