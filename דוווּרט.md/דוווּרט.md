דוווּרט
'Warta (town in central Poland)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that the name was borrowed from Old Polish, before the 16th c., when the first vowel of Warta was long /aː/ (perhaps the vowel was lengthened in a stressed syllable before /r/ and a second consonant). The vowel merged with A₂ and had the corresponding different realizations in Yiddish dialects (e.g., "Dvūrt" in CY).
