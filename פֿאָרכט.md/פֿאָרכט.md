פֿאָרכט

'awe, dread'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
{Interesting that Yiddish preserves the MHG vowel /o/. DW² writes that the -u- began to appear in the 13th c. based on the verb MHG vurhten (see פֿאָרכטן) from Central German, displacing -o- by the 18th c.
Interesting that the noun פֿאָרכט has the same vowel as the verb פֿאָרכטן - which may just continue MHG vorht and vorhten directly. Or perhaps פֿאָרכט is a new deverbal noun created from פֿאָרכטן, or פֿאָרכטן is a new verb based on פֿאָרכט.}
OE fyrhto, English fright, OS for(a)hta, OHG for(a)hta, MHG vorhte, vorht, NHG Furcht < PGmc. *furhtō- 'fright' < *prk-t-eh₂- (DRV), derived from an adjective *furhta- 'fearful': Got. faurhts, OS for(a)ht, OHG for(a)ht, gotaforht 'God-fearing' < PIE *prk-to-; apparently to-formation from the PIE root *perk-, itself an extension of the root *per- (in words like געפֿאַר).
Related: Tocharian AB präskā- 'to fear'.
