'Buchach (town in Western Ukraine)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that the name was borrowed from Old Polish, before the 16th c., when the second vowel was still long /aː/. The vowel merged with A₂ and had the corresponding different realizations in Yiddish dialects. 
Polish Buczacz; cf. Ukrainian Бучач.
