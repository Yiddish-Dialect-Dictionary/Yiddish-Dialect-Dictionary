'Tatar'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests that Y could have borrowed the word either from German or Polish {but the reflexes of protovowel A₃, from a lengthened /a/ in an open syllable, suggest German.}
MHG tater, tarter; Polish Tatar; from medieval Latin Tartarus; from Turkic tatar. 
[Beider 2015: 454; DW¹ 21: 158]
