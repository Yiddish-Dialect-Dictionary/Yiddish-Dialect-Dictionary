'vein'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
{DW² notes that the original meaning in German was any vessel or ligament in the body: sinew, muscle, intestine, tissue. Thanks to the influence of medieval medicine and the teachings of Hippocrates about the four humors and the use of blood-letting to restore their "balance", the meaning 'vein' came to dominate. Kluge/Seebold write that the narrowing of the meaning to 'vein' only arose in NHG, probably to differentiate it from Nerv 'nerve' and Sehne 'sinew'. Yiddish lacks a cognate to Sehne, still the meaning has been narrowed in Yiddish as well. Perhaps the role Jews played as doctors had an influence?}
ON æðr 'vein', OE ǣdre 'river; vein, artery; nerve, siney; kidney', OS -āđara, Dutch ader 'vein', OHG ād(a)ra 'vein, sinew, muscle', MHG âder, NHG Ader 'sinew, (pl.) bowels' > PGmc. *ēþrō- ~ *ēdrō- 'vein, rivulet' (or *ǣd(a)rō) < PIE *h₁eh₁t-r- (perhaps originally a mobile paradigm:  *h₁éh₁t-r-, (pl.)  *h₁h₁t-ṓr-) (or from *ēt-r- or *ēter-); perhaps the same root as *eþman- ~ *ēdman- 'breath' (seet אָטעם).
