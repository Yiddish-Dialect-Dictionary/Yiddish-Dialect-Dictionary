קלייט
־ן
די
'store, shop'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider suggests the word may have been borrowed from the dialect of Polesia, where the root vowel was the diphthong {ie} - borrowed into Yiddish as {ej}. Or perhaps the word is much older and is from the East Cnaanic substrate - from the Slavic language originally spoken by Jews in the Grand Dutch of Lithuania before they shifted to Yiddish (by the 17th c.).
Polish (obsolete) kleta, kletka 'store'; Ukrainian клiть 'cage; shop'.
{Beider 2015: 440-1; Herzog 1964: 98}

Characteristic especially for SOUTHEASTERN. קלייט was probably previously more widespread in other dialects, but was supplanted by געוועלב in CENTRAL and קראָם in NORTHEASTERN.
