ETYMOLOGY
===========
{Yiddish word is perhaps unrelated to MHG fochen, which has a different meaning and seems to have been infrequent. The structure with the Yiddish verb is also characteristic of a Slavic source. Maybe it is a back-formation from פֿעכער 'fan', NHG Fächer, (older) focher? But פֿעכער is from the same MHG fochen! But Kluge/Seebold say it is from Latin focare.}
Icelandic fokka 'to mess around, rush', Middle Dutch vocken 'to blow', MHG fochen 'to blow', ENHG fochen, NHG ent-fachen < PGmc. *fuk(k)ōn- 'to blow' < *pug-néh₂- (EUR?).
Related to Latvian pūga 'gust of wind', or Armenian p'uk 'breath, wind, fart'
{DW¹ 3: 1863; Kluge/Seebold 2011: 270; Kroonen 2013: 158; Lexer 3: 424}
