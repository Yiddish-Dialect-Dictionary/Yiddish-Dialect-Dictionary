Commit the File:

Scroll down to find the "Commit new file" section.
You can add a commit message (optional), then click on the "Commit directly to the main branch" button.
Now, the index.html file has been added to your repository. This should also help you in setting up GitHub Pages if that's what you're aiming for.
