'to banter, kibetz' (ᴠᴇʀʙ)

ETYMOLOGY
===========
{Curious that the DW¹ only lists the bird meaning of Kiebitz. A sign that the Rotswelsch/Yiddish meaning was still widely unfamiliar in German when this volume of the DW¹ was published in 1873.}
NHG Kiebetz 'northern lapwing (bird species)'; from MHG gîbitze; perhaps because of the bird's characteristic cry.
Or a Rotwelsch word...
Polish kibic 'sports fan' (borrowed from NHG)
