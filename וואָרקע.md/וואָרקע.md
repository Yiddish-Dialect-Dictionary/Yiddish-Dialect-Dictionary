וואָרקע
וווּרקע
'Warka (Polish city south of Warsaw)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Herzog writes that in CY וואָרקע was rendered Vurke because the word entered Yiddish from a Polish dialect where the vowel was /o/, which was then subject to the regular shift o > u in SY. {However, וואָרקע was possibly derived from the MHG or ENHG version of the city's name...}
{Herzog 1964: 117-119}
Beider suggests that the name was borrowed from Old Polish, before the 16th c., when the first vowel of Tarnów was long /aː/ (perhaps the vowel was lengthened in a stressed syllable before /r/ and a second consonant). The vowel merged with A₂ and had the corresponding different realizations in Yiddish dialects (e.g., "Vūrke" in CY).
