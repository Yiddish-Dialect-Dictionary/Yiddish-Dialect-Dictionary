(quantité) considérable, important, non négligeable

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Although the form appears Germanic (from the verb שפּאָרן), the meaning seems to derive from Polish sporo 'quite a lot', spory 'considerable, largish', from Proto-Slavic *sporъ 'abundant, lavish', cf. Old Church Slavonic споръ 'plentiful'; which appears related to the same root PIE *sph₁rós as Latin prosperus, PGmc *sparaz, English spare, German spar(sam), sparen (see שפּאָרן).
