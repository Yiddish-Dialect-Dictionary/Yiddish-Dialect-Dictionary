דאַמף
די
דאַמפּ
'steam, vapor'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
{Interesting that דאַמף is the main Yiddish form, not דאַמפּ, because in Eastern Yiddish dialects, as in East Central German dialects, -mp- is not usually shifted to -mpf- as in Upper German dialects and in NHG. But the ENHG citations (where damp does not occur) perhaps indicate that dampf was more widespread even in East Central German dialects.}
English damp, Dutch damp, OHG dampf, MHG dampf, tampf, ENHD dampf, tampf, NHG Dampf < PGmc. *dampᵖa- or *dampa- (DRV), derived from *dimban- ~ *dimpan- (MHG dimpfen 'to spoke, steam'), from the PIE root *dʰem- 'to smoke'.
