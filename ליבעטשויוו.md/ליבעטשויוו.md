'Lubaczów (town in southestern Poland)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Beider argues that the word must have been borrowed from Old Polish before the 16th c. while the final vowel of Lubaczów was still long /oː/. Beider also conjectures that in Old Polish the name was stressed on the final syllable, as in Yiddish.
Polish Lubaczów; cf. Ukrainian Любачів.
