'Duma (Russian parliament)'

ETYMOLOGY
===========
Russian ду́ма 'thought; parliament'; from Proto-Slavic *duma; cf. Polish duma 'pride'; Ukrainian ду́ма 'thought; song' (see דומע 2); possibly borrowed from PGmc. *dōmaz 'judgment', cf. English doom; Got. dōms, 'judgment, act, thought', dōmjan 'to judge'; or perhaps a deverbal fro Proto-Slavic *duti 'to blow'; from PIE *dʰewh₂- 'to smoke'. 
[Vasmer/Trubachev 1552]
